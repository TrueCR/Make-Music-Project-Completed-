<h2><u>Overview</u></h2>

This code is pretty simple, type in the text box and the letters/words you type will appear at the bottom, right under "Output". You will also notice that after every space you make in your sentences, each word will be highlighted according to each sentence length. Yellow is the smallest sentence you can make, coming right after that with a red highlight, after that is a green highlight and the longest sentence you can make will be in a blue highlight. The only way to guarantee it will work is to try it yourself by typing in the text box.

<h2><u>Planning</u></h2>

<ul>
    <li>How to get a text box implemented to make an output underneath the box.</li>
    <li>How to get it so when the words appear the sentence will be highlighted according to its length.</li>
    <li>How to make a drop down menu that makes it able for the user to change the colors.</li>
</ul>

<h2><u>Review</u></h2>

In my opinion this was quite difficult since I forgot a lot of the code from last year and had to go through a lot of google searches and talking to people on how to do it and what each tag meant such as .match, .alert, etc.
